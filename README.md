# Ising 3d Markov Chain MonteCarlo

#### UV sampler method implemented in one class holding MCMC updates ( using [Swendsenâ€“Wang algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swendsen%E2%80%93Wang_algorithm) with different boundary conditions), discrete lattice dilations for different prescriptions and sample IO (with serialization).

##### Details in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11045](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11045) and [Phys. Rev. E 96, 033301](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.033301).
